/**
 * The admin panel's shape, in one place.
 *
 * Three lists used to describe the same twelve screens: the sidebar in
 * AdminLayout, the permission table in AdminRoute, and the route elements in
 * App.jsx. Keeping them in step was a manual invariant, and it had already
 * failed once — Leads appeared in an editor's sidebar and then refused to open,
 * because the permission table had no entry for it and fell through to the
 * admin-only default. A link you can see and cannot use is worse than no link.
 *
 * So the sidebar, the guard and each page's title now all read from here. The
 * three can no longer disagree, because there is only one of them.
 *
 * `icon` is a string rather than a component so this module stays import-free:
 * the guard and the tests can load it without pulling in React. AdminLayout
 * owns the name → component mapping.
