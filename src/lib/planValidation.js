 * Three near-identical forms with subtly different parsing is how the two bugs
 * this replaces got in:
 *
 *   1. `parseInt(form.renewable_percentage) || 100` turned a legitimate 0 into
 *      100, because 0 is falsy. A conventional plan saved through the
 *      renewable screen was published as 100% renewable.
 *
 *   2. The forms selected a provider by NAME and wrote only `provider_name`,
 *      so a new plan carried no `provider_id`. Migration 014 had to backfill
 *      hundreds of historical rows by name matching; nothing stopped the next
 *      admin-created plan from needing the same repair.
 *
 * The rule throughout: blank, zero, invalid and absent are four different
 * things and must stay that way. Never coerce an unparseable value into a
 * number a customer will be charged against.
