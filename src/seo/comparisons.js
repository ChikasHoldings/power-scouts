/**
 * comparisons.js
 *
 * The head-to-head ("versus") pages: /compare/:slug.
 *
 * Two kinds of page live here, and they exist for the same reason. "TXU vs
 * Reliant" and "fixed vs variable" are the questions people type when they have
 * already decided to switch and are down to the last choice. Until now the site
 * answered neither, and the footer pointed that intent at
 * /compare-rates?planType=fixed — a query-string variant of a page that already
 * self-canonicalizes, so it earned nothing and invited a crawl of parameter
 * permutations.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THIS FROM BECOMING A DOORWAY FARM
 *
 * 35 suppliers make 595 ordered pairs, and 300 of them share a state. Publishing
 * those would be the textbook doorway pattern: hundreds of URLs, one template, a
 * name swapped. So a supplier matchup is published only when all of these hold:
 *
 *   1. It is on the curated list below. Curation is editorial — these are
 *      matchups a real shopper faces (two brands sold into the same market,
 *      usually both well known) — and it is the reason the set is ~16 and not
 *      300.
 *   2. Both suppliers still qualify for their own detail page.
 *   3. They still overlap in at least one state. Two suppliers that never
 *      compete for the same customer are not a choice, and the page is dropped
 *      automatically rather than published as an empty comparison.
 *   4. The snapshot holds a rate for both in at least one shared state, so the
 *      central table has something in it.
 *
 * A matchup that stops qualifying disappears from the registry, the sitemap and
 * the prerender in the same build. Nothing has to be remembered by hand.
 *
 * The differences between pages are computed, not written. Every verdict, every
 * table row and every FAQ answer is derived from the two suppliers' own numbers,
 * so two pages are as similar as the suppliers are — and the regression suite
 * asserts the family's mean similarity stays below the city pages'.
 *
 * Plain ESM, no dependencies: the React pages, the prerenderer, the sitemap and
 * the tests all import this same module, so the rendered page and the crawled
 * page cannot disagree about what a comparison says.

 * Plan-shape comparisons

 * Deliberately about plan *shapes*, never about two named plans. Individual

 * shape — fixed against variable, 12 months against 24 — is stable, and the

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Insights for the plan-shape comparisons
 *
 * A comparison whose metric is countable ("279 fixed against 97 variable")
 * earns a "Where the Balance Tips" section off those counts. The three whose
 * metric is not countable — a term is offered or it is not, a renewable rate is
 * a price rather than a tally — fell through that branch and got nothing, which
 * is the whole reason they are the thinnest indexable pages on the site at 352
 * and 358 words against a family median of 627.
 *
 * So they get the same treatment from the data they do have. Everything below
 * is counted from the market snapshot: no claim here is written by hand, and a
 * market missing the field it needs drops out of its own sentence rather than
 * being guessed at.
