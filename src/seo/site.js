/**
 * site.js
 *
 * THE single source of truth for the production origin used by every SEO
 * surface: canonical tags, Open Graph URLs, JSON-LD, sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
 *
 * Why the apex: production serves the site on https://electricscouts.com, and
 * https://www.electricscouts.com answers 308 to it. A canonical URL must point
 * at a URL that returns 200 directly, so the canonical host has to be the one
 * that is actually served.
 *
 * This file used to say the opposite, and it cost the site its index. The
 * primary domain in the Vercel project was flipped to the apex; this constant
 * was not. Every page then served 200 at the apex while declaring a canonical
 * at www — a host that 308s straight back — so all 335 canonicals, every
 * og:url and JSON-LD @id, and all 335 sitemap URLs pointed at a redirect.
 * Google's response to a canonical it cannot resolve to a 200 is to disregard
 * it and pick its own, and the sitemap read as 335 redirects. Verified against
 * production before the change:
 *
 *   GET https://electricscouts.com/compare-rates      -> 200, no Location
 *       ...its canonical said https://www.electricscouts.com/compare-rates
 *   GET https://www.electricscouts.com/compare-rates  -> 308 -> the apex
 *
 * The earlier comment here was right about one thing: this constant and the
 * Vercel primary domain are a matched pair and must move together. If the
 * primary domain is ever flipped back to www, flip this back in the same
 * change — never one without the other.
 *
 * This module is plain ESM with no dependencies so it can be imported from the
 * browser bundle, from Vercel serverless functions and from Node build scripts.

 * build can prove it still redirects. The whole canonical strategy rests on it.
 * Every canonical, og:url, JSON-LD @id and sitemap entry names the apex; if www
 * ever answered 200 instead of 308, the site would have a second complete copy
 * on a host Google already knows well — the same failure the .vercel.app
 * aliases had, on the host with the most history behind it.
 *
 * It also carries the migration. Until 2026-08-22 this file said www, so the
 * sitemap listed 335 www URLs and that is the host Google's crawl history is
 * attached to. A different host is a different URL, so the apex URLs entered
 * discovery as new pages. The www redirect is what tells Google they are the
 * same pages moved rather than 335 unrelated ones, which is the difference
 * between recrawling a known site and queueing an unknown one.
 *
 * Derived from SITE_URL rather than written out, so it stays correct if the
 * canonical host ever moves. Empty when the canonical host is itself a www
 * host, because then there is nothing to redirect away.
