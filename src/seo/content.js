/**
 * content.js
 *
 * Builds the *content model* for every prerendered page: the sections, facts,
 * tables and questions a page is entitled to show, given the data we actually
 * hold about it.
 *
 * This file is the answer to "why should Google index 144 city pages?". It is
 * deliberately structured so that a section only exists when the data behind it
 * exists — a city with no utility on record simply has no utility section,
 * rather than a sentence with an empty slot in it. Nothing here invents a
 * number, a rate, a review or a saving; every figure traces back to
 * src/data/cityRatesData.js, src/components/location/locationData.js or the
 * market snapshot in src/seo/market-data.json.
 *
 * Returns plain data. src/seo/render.js turns it into HTML; tests assert
 * against it directly without parsing markup.

 *      to our median they read as the same figure disagreeing with itself —
 *      Illinois said 14.3¢/kWh beside a snapshot median of 8.99¢.
 *
 * What survives is the durable, checkable material: when the state deregulated,

 * different arrangements, but it meant two utilities sharing a model and a
 * state shared almost the whole page. ComEd and Ameren Illinois are the worst

 * and every rate figure were identical, and only the opening note and the city
 * table told them apart. Measured as six-gram overlap the pair sat at 0.53,
 * the highest of any two pages on the site.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented to fix that. Every value comes from the cities we
 * already cover in the territory, or from the other territories we publish in
 * the same state. Delivery tariffs would be the natural way to separate these
 * pages and we do not hold them, so this separates them on what we do hold.
